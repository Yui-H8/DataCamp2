# End-to-End RAG with Weaviate
---
### Description

Learn how to go from simple LLM calls to multi-modal RAG workflows with Weaviate! You'll learn how to process PDF documents to extract key text content like paragraphs, headings, and tables. You'll embed and store this data for retrieval with Weaviate. Finally, you'll craft effective retrieval prompts to pass to generative models. To cap this all off, you'll treat PDFs as images to allow you to capture context lost from images and plots. You'll use the ColPali multi-modal embedding model with a multi-modal generative model from OpenAI to begin having conversations with images and documents!

* Ask the LLM the general knowledge question.
* Ask the LLM about Weaviate's work-from-home policy.
* Ask the same question again, but this time, integrating additional context into the prompt, stored in weaviate_wfh_facts.
