# Introduction to Embeddings with the OpenAI API
---
**Description**  
Text embedding models create numerical representations from text inputs. This ability to encode text and capture its semantic meaning means that embedding models underpin many types of AI applications, like semantic search engines and recommendation engines. In this course, you'll learn how to harness OpenAI's Embeddings model via the OpenAI API to create embeddings from text datasets and begin developing real-world applications. You'll also take a big step towards creating production-ready applications by learning about vector databases to efficiently store and query embedded texts.

### What are embeddings?
Which of the following statements about embedding models are correct?
* They create numerical representations of text
* They capture the semantic meaning behind text

*Nice job! This ability to extract the semantic meaning behind text in numerical form unlocks all sorts of different AI applications. Let's see if you can recognize them in the next exercise!*

### Embeddings applications
Embedding models convert text into numerical representations that are able to capture the context and intent behind the text. This unlocks powerful applications beyond what is possible with other types of AI models.

In this exercise, you'll test your ability to identify use cases for embedding models.

*Embeddings can be used for quite a few different tasks, but they really shine in recommendation, classification, and semantic search, so we'll return to these applications throughout the course. Time to create your very first embeddings using the OpenAI API! Best of luck!*
