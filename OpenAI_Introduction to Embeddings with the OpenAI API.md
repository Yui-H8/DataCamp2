# Introduction to Embeddings with the OpenAI API
---
**Description**  
Text embedding models create numerical representations from text inputs. This ability to encode text and capture its semantic meaning means that embedding models underpin many types of AI applications, like semantic search engines and recommendation engines. In this course, you'll learn how to harness OpenAI's Embeddings model via the OpenAI API to create embeddings from text datasets and begin developing real-world applications. You'll also take a big step towards creating production-ready applications by learning about vector databases to efficiently store and query embedded texts.

### What are embeddings?
Which of the following statements about embedding models are correct?
* They create numerical representations of text
* They capture the semantic meaning behind text

*Nice job! This ability to extract the semantic meaning behind text in numerical form unlocks all sorts of different AI applications. Let's see if you can recognize them in the next exercise!*
