# Develop Azure Event-based and Message-based Solutions
---
**Description**

This course teaches you how to build event-driven and asynchronous architectures in Azure and connect them to third-party services such as webhooks, messaging platforms, and external applications.


You’ll start by understanding the fundamentals of event-driven architecture and why it is essential for modern cloud systems. From there, you’ll work hands-on with Azure Event Grid, Event Hubs, Queue Storage, and Azure Service Bus to route, filter, and process events at scale.


Through practical exercises, you’ll learn how to publish and subscribe to events, trigger Azure Functions, integrate external systems, and design reliable messaging workflows. As the course progresses, you’ll explore advanced patterns like dead-lettering, retries, session-based processing, duplicate detection, and large-scale streaming pipelines.


By the end of the course, you’ll be able to design and implement scalable, resilient, and event-driven solutions that seamlessly connect Azure services with third-party systems—skills that are directly applicable to real-world cloud applications and Azure developer roles.

### Understanding event-driven architecture
A financial services company currently uses a polling-based system that checks for stock price changes every 30 seconds. Traders have complained that they are missing critical price movements because updates arrive too late. The development team is evaluating a move to event-driven architecture. What is the primary advantage of this approach over their current polling-based system?
