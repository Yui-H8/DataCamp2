# Responsible AI Data Management
---
**Description**

Handling data responsibly is critical, particularly in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This conceptual course will teach you the fundamentals of responsible data practices, including data acquisition, key regulations, and data validation and bias mitigation strategies. You can apply these skills to use critical thinking on any data project, ensuring you have a successful, responsible, and compliant project from start to finish.

### Developing AI responsibly
Balancing technical efficiency with responsible AI dimensions is crucial when building an AI project. The former focuses on accuracy, efficiency, and optimization, while the latter ensures AI systems do not perpetuate biases or discrimination.

Identify the statements that are true for responsible AI development. Select the three answers that apply.
```
〇 High assessment on fairness does not guarantee high model accuracy
〇 Diversity ensures equal representation and treatment of all groups in model outcomes
Accuracy guarantees fairness and responsible AI outcomes in model's performance
Efficient resources use ensures ethical and fair AI in model development
〇 Responsible AI practice integrates diverse demographics, reducing inadvertent biases in modeling
```
*Great job at balancing tech and ethics!*

### Dimensions of responsible data
The start of any project involves understanding how to integrate and implement responsible data dimensions. This ensures the ethical development and deployment of AI tools and fosters public trust.
* Classify the statements into the correct dimensions.

*Kudos for understanding the role of each responsible data dimension in an ethical AI project!*

### Planning a responsible AI project
Planning is the key to a responsible AI project. A healthcare company wants to develop an AI tool to use images to classify skin conditions and increase the accuracy of diagnoses. You are working on this project.

Which steps should you plan to incorporate responsible data use throughout the project? Select the three answers that apply.
```
Ensure compliance with laws for medical data
Ensure the dataset has diverse skin types, ages, genders, and ethnicities
Identify any underrepresented groups in the data to avoid biased or inaccurate results
Data is provided by the healthcare company and bias assessment is not required
Monitoring post-deployment changes in data is outside of your scope
```
*Bravo on advancing healthcare innovation responsibly!*

### Responsible data use
AI-driven advertising systems are popular, highlighting a need for responsible AI practices to ensure fairness and transparency in ad targeting.

> In this scenario, AI Culture Horizon, a cultural organization, faced issues with its AI-driven promotional campaign for a new free museum opening. The company's AI model, which used data on users' browsing history and demographics, came under scrutiny. Concerns were raised that the algorithm disproportionately targeted advertisements towards higher-income neighborhoods, inadvertently neglecting broader outreach and engagement with diverse communities.

*Congratulations! You are a hero of AI-driven targeted advertising!*

### Fairness in AI projects
You're part of a team developing an AI student admission system for universities. This system aims to fairly evaluate applicants based on various factors. The team considers three different approaches to assess fairness in the project, including disparate impact, equal opportunity and demographic parity.

### Trade-offs in responsible AI
Applying responsible AI in real-world scenarios demands professional judgment, a skill that can only be fully developed through practical experience and hands-on involvement in diverse AI projects. Working through short scenarios allows you to train your ethical muscles and build skills in responsible data dimensions.

### Professional duties and ethical conduct
Responsible data management practices are aligned with and guided by the professional code of conduct, which establishes the duties and responsibilities of data professionals. Understanding these duties and responsibilities is key to responsible AI and growing a successful professional career in technology.

Which of these statements correctly describes this professional code of conduct? Select the two answers that apply.
```
〇 Ethical conduct is in protecting the privacy of users and handling their data with confidentiality\
Professional duties prioritize tech's positive societal impact over risks\
〇 Ethical tech conduct demands fairness, preventing discrimination in solutions\
Tech excellence and robustness ensure innovation and should be prioritized
Any innovation has risk, but its future value can outweigh ethical considerations and potential dilemmas
```
*Bravo on professional and ethical growth!*

### Data protection laws
In data protection and privacy regulation, pivotal laws include the GDPR in the EU, HIPAA in the US, and the CCPA in California. Understanding the fundamental principles of these regulations is essential for AI projects.
* Classify the statements as either GDPR, HIPAA or CCPA.

*Congratulations! Understanding key aspects of data regulations puts you on the path to success in AI projects.*

### Data regulation in a project
You work for a UK healthcare company and develop an AI diagnostic tool for providers in the EU and US. You have already booked a meeting with the legal team and now researching relevant data laws to gain insight.
* Group each data regulation for the use case.

*Well done on your research! Now you're all prepped for the meeting with the legal team!*

### Data owner rights and compliance
You develop a recommender system for an online health food shop. The system uses customer data, including dietary preferences, purchase history, and health goals, and data from local organic farms about seasonal produce availability and sourcing practices.

You're planning for a meeting with a legal team to discuss how to manage the consent around the customer data. Before you go in, you have decided on some approaches you believe to be suitable. Which two options do you bring to the meeting to discuss?
```
〇 Informed consent is required for personal data such as family name and date of birth
〇 Informed consent can be acquired through interactive prompts, checkboxes, and clear opt-in/opt-out options
A DUA is necessary for external organic farms to ensure proper handling and data use
The DUA establishes the informed consent procedure for the personal customer data
Informed consent is obtained after the personal data is tested in an AI model
```
*Excellent take on compliance practices!*

### Data use agreements (DUAs)
Consent for organizational data is typically obtained through formal contracts, such as Data Use Agreements (DUAs). These agreements are essential in data sharing between companies in an AI project. Knowing the common parts of DUAs helps developers quickly identify terms of usage and clarify data compliance issues.

*Mastering the components of DUA ensures accurate data utilization in the project—well done!*

### Types of licenses
The pretrained model RoBERTa-Large, available on the Hugging Face platform, is widely utilized within the AI community. Its license outlines the permissible use of the model, ensuring compliance and ethical utilization:

License: mit

*Congratulations! Understanding licenses is a knowledge that you need for your AI mastery!*

### Licensing agreements
Understanding the common elements of license agreements ensures legal compliance and proper use of data, especially in AI projects where data usage is fundamental. Licensing agreements outlines developers' rights and obligations, preventing potential legal disputes and creating trust and transparency. Which of the following components are likely to be in a licensing agreement?

*You're on your way to ensuring proper legal compliance and usage.*
