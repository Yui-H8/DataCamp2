# Responsible AI Data Management
---
**Description**

Handling data responsibly is critical, particularly in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This conceptual course will teach you the fundamentals of responsible data practices, including data acquisition, key regulations, and data validation and bias mitigation strategies. You can apply these skills to use critical thinking on any data project, ensuring you have a successful, responsible, and compliant project from start to finish.

### Developing AI responsibly
Balancing technical efficiency with responsible AI dimensions is crucial when building an AI project. The former focuses on accuracy, efficiency, and optimization, while the latter ensures AI systems do not perpetuate biases or discrimination.

Identify the statements that are true for responsible AI development. Select the three answers that apply.
```
〇 High assessment on fairness does not guarantee high model accuracy
〇 Diversity ensures equal representation and treatment of all groups in model outcomes
Accuracy guarantees fairness and responsible AI outcomes in model's performance
Efficient resources use ensures ethical and fair AI in model development
〇 Responsible AI practice integrates diverse demographics, reducing inadvertent biases in modeling
```
*Great job at balancing tech and ethics!*

### Dimensions of responsible data
The start of any project involves understanding how to integrate and implement responsible data dimensions. This ensures the ethical development and deployment of AI tools and fosters public trust.
* Classify the statements into the correct dimensions.

*Kudos for understanding the role of each responsible data dimension in an ethical AI project!*

### Planning a responsible AI project
Planning is the key to a responsible AI project. A healthcare company wants to develop an AI tool to use images to classify skin conditions and increase the accuracy of diagnoses. You are working on this project.

Which steps should you plan to incorporate responsible data use throughout the project? Select the three answers that apply.
```
Ensure compliance with laws for medical data
Ensure the dataset has diverse skin types, ages, genders, and ethnicities
Identify any underrepresented groups in the data to avoid biased or inaccurate results
Data is provided by the healthcare company and bias assessment is not required
Monitoring post-deployment changes in data is outside of your scope
```
*Bravo on advancing healthcare innovation responsibly!*

### Responsible data use
AI-driven advertising systems are popular, highlighting a need for responsible AI practices to ensure fairness and transparency in ad targeting.

> In this scenario, AI Culture Horizon, a cultural organization, faced issues with its AI-driven promotional campaign for a new free museum opening. The company's AI model, which used data on users' browsing history and demographics, came under scrutiny. Concerns were raised that the algorithm disproportionately targeted advertisements towards higher-income neighborhoods, inadvertently neglecting broader outreach and engagement with diverse communities.

*Congratulations! You are a hero of AI-driven targeted advertising!*

### Fairness in AI projects
You're part of a team developing an AI student admission system for universities. This system aims to fairly evaluate applicants based on various factors. The team considers three different approaches to assess fairness in the project, including disparate impact, equal opportunity and demographic parity.

### Trade-offs in responsible AI
Applying responsible AI in real-world scenarios demands professional judgment, a skill that can only be fully developed through practical experience and hands-on involvement in diverse AI projects. Working through short scenarios allows you to train your ethical muscles and build skills in responsible data dimensions.
