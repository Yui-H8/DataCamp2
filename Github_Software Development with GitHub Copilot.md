# Software Development with GitHub Copilot
---
**Description**

GitHub Copilot is more than a smart autocomplete—it’s an AI coding assistant that helps you understand, write, and improve code with ease. In this course, you’ll explore Copilot in Visual Studio Code, from autocomplete suggestions to inline edits and chat-based modes, and discover how to use each effectively for tasks ranging from quick fixes to multi-file refactoring. You’ll learn how to provide the right context through chat variables, participants, and progressive prompting, while also streamlining your workflow with slash commands and smart actions. Finally, you’ll shape Copilot’s behavior with custom instructions and model selection, tailoring it to project standards or team conventions. By the end, you’ll have the skills to turn Copilot into a powerful coding partner—boosting productivity, reducing errors, and adapting to both personal and team workflows.

### What can Copilot really do?
You've been tasked with rolling out GitHub Copilot across your development team and need to write guidelines explaining how Copilot can help developers accomplish their goals.

You'd like to ensure the team understands the full range of capabilities available.

Which of the following should you include as examples of what Copilot can help developers do?
```
〇 Explain what complex code does by analyzing it and summarizing it
〇 Diagnose bugs by walking through error traces and identifying root causes
〇 Write tests covering edge cases and different scenarios
Automatically monitor production systems and fix bugs without human oversight
```
*Well done! You’ve picked the right examples of what Copilot can help with. It’s great at writing, testing, and explaining

### Highlight, prompt, done
You're fixing a small bug in the .mark_completed() method.

The logic is almost correct, but the task isn't marked complete. You've highlighted the function and want Copilot to help you fix it.

Based on this task and what's shown in the image, which Copilot interface is best suited for this situation?
```
Copilot Chat - Ask Mode
Copilot Chat - Edit Mode
〇 Inline Chat
Autocomplete
```
*Inline Chat is perfect for quick fixes of small, contained bugs.*

### No edits, just ideas
After fixing some bugs in task_manager.py, you want to make the script more modular. You open Copilot Chat in Ask Mode and type:

"How can I restructure this app using a service layer?"

Based on what you've learned, what can you expect Copilot to do in this mode?
```
Copilot will refactor your code to add a service layer
〇 Copilot will suggest an app structure, but won't modify your code
Copilot will search the web and provide a Stack Overflow link
Copilot will show all files it plans to change
```
*Correct! Ask Mode provides you guidance without modifying code.*

### Inline, Ask, or Edit? You decide
You've used Copilot to fix a bug in a method and asked for architectural advice on how to modularize the app.

Now you're looking at a list of remaining tasks; some are quick edits, others need deeper planning or bigger changes.

Let's match each task to the Copilot interface that fits it best.
* Classify each task into the Copilot interface that's best suited for it.
  
*Nice work! You've matched each task to the Copilot interface that fits it best. Knowing when to use Inline, Ask, or Edit Mode helps you get faster, more accurate results from Copilot.*

### What sets Agent Mode apart
You're starting a large refactor across multiple files in your project.

Instead of editing each file manually, you open Copilot's Agent Mode and describe the goal.

Which of the following statements is true about how Agent Mode operates?
