# Software Development with GitHub Copilot
---
**Description**

GitHub Copilot is more than a smart autocomplete—it’s an AI coding assistant that helps you understand, write, and improve code with ease. In this course, you’ll explore Copilot in Visual Studio Code, from autocomplete suggestions to inline edits and chat-based modes, and discover how to use each effectively for tasks ranging from quick fixes to multi-file refactoring. You’ll learn how to provide the right context through chat variables, participants, and progressive prompting, while also streamlining your workflow with slash commands and smart actions. Finally, you’ll shape Copilot’s behavior with custom instructions and model selection, tailoring it to project standards or team conventions. By the end, you’ll have the skills to turn Copilot into a powerful coding partner—boosting productivity, reducing errors, and adapting to both personal and team workflows.
