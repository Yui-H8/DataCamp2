# Working with the OpenAI Responses API
---
**Description**

Building AI applications has never been more accessible with the Responses API! In this course, you’ll learn how to prompt models through a simple interface, follow best practices for reasoning models, and design natural back-and-forth conversations with LLMs. You’ll unlock the full power of LLMs by integrating tools—like web search with no extra API keys or credentials—and by building your own to extend model capabilities beyond their base knowledge. You’ll also learn how to take your applications from prototype to production with three key design paradigms, generate reliable structured outputs like JSON, stream real-time semantic events for interactive user experiences, and go multi-modal by combining text and images using OpenAI’s GPT-5 models.
