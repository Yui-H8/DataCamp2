### Creating Text Embeddings
* Embed the text string provided and view its length and the first five numbers in the embedding vector.
* Embed the strings in the texts list in a single embedding API request, and compare the length and numbers of each embedding vector.
* Embed the texts list again, but this time, change the model output dimensions to 512.
  
**What are vector embeddings?**    
Vector embeddings represent semantic meaning as a set of numbers. The key concept of vector embeddings is that similar meanings or concepts are close together in this space.
