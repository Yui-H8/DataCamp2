# Supervised Learning with scikit-learn

### Binary classification
### The supervised learning workflow
Recall that scikit-learn offers a repeatable workflow for using supervised learning models to predict the target variable values when presented with new data.

Reorder the pseudo-code provided so it accurately represents the workflow of building a supervised learning model and making predictions.


*Correct! This configuration ensures at least two instances always run for redundancy (minimum desired capacity), maintains three instances during normal operations (desired capacity), and allows scaling up to ten instances during high demand (maximum desired capacity). The Auto Scaling Group will create new instances when demand exceeds capacity and terminate instances when demand decreases, always staying within these bounds.*
